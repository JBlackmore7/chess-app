# Chess

- I made a simple chess app using ReactJS
- Live demo [_here_](https://jblackmore7.github.io/chess-app).

## Inspiration

- This project was inspired by an old paper work order system that was used at a previous employer. They had to be written by hand which made it difficult to read some employees hand writing, the actual order itself changed hands multiple times which resulted in missing orders and confusion, there was only finite space on the paper work order which sometimes led to multiple orders being used for the same job. I could honestly go on for a while about the downsides of paper work orders -- suffice it to say I was very passionate about digitizing this process.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS

## Features

- Work Flow was originally set up using a fake rest API that handled all of the data on localhost, but I decided to use localStorage instead to highlight my application. The old fetch requests and response handling are commented out in my source code if you want to check them out.
- I have starter data hard coded into the project but all work orders that you create and manipulate will remain on the application until you clear your browsing data/cookies and website data.

## Room for Improvement

- Refactoring -- multiple JS files/functions that could be condensed and too much hard coded HTML.

To do:

- The ability to edit a work order in any state

## Acknowledgements

- Many thanks to @samwise-nl for guiding me through this process and giving me tons of ideas and best practice methods!
